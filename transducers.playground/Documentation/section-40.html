    <p>This is all done with a single pass of the array of integers <code>1...200</code>, and it stops the moment 10 twin primes are found.</p>
<p>Note that we had to choose a large enough range (<code>1...200</code> in this case) to ensure that we would fine all the twin primes we were looking for. That&#39;s an unfortunate choice to make. Instead, it would be nice to work on the full sequence of positive integers so we didn&#39;t have to worry about this. In fact, transducers are great for working on <em>any</em> list-like data type (streams, sequences, arrays, ...), and we could easily beef up everything we&#39;ve done so far to work in the more general setting. </p>
